died
on
the
third
day
from
where
did
you
come

west
citadel
beyond
the
mountains
the
men
who

one
has
all
her
teeth
oh
i
cant
wait
for
them
to
see
it
see
see
what
home
the
green
place
but
if
you
came
from
the
west
you
passed
it
the
crows
the
creepy
place
with
all
the
crows
the
soil
we
had
to
get
out
we
had
no
water
the
water
was
filth
it
was
poisoned
it
was
sour
and
then
the
crows
came
we
couldnt
grow
anything
where
are
the
others
what
others
the
many
mothers
were
the
only
ones
left

call
a
satellite
miss

us
about
those
they
used
to
bounce
messages
across
the
earth
shows
everyone
in
the
old
world
had
a
show
do
you
think
theres
still
somebody
out
there
sending
shows
who
knows

are
the
plains
of
silence

was
no
need
to
snap
anybody

talk
to
you
ive
talked
with
the
others
were
never
gonna
have
a
better
chance
to
make
it
across
the
salt
if
we
leave
the
rig
here
and
load
the
motorcycles
up
with
as
much
as
we
can
we
can
maybe
ride
for
160
days
one
of
those
bikes
is
yours
fully
loaded
youre
more
than
welcome
to
come
with
us
ill
make
my
own
way
you

a
mistake
if
you
cant
fix
whats
broken
youll
uh
youll
go
insane
where
are
you
max
where
are
you
help
us
you
promised
to
help
us
come
on
pa
lets
go
all
right
this
is
your
way
home
we
go
back
mm
back
yeah
i
thought
you
werent
insane
anymore
what
are
they
saying
he
wants
to
go
back
from
where
they
came
the
citadel
whats
there
to
find
at
the
citadel
green
and
water
theres
a
ridiculous
amount
of
clear
water
and
a
lot
of
crops
got
everything
you
need
long
as
youre
not
afraid
of
heights
where
does
the
water
come
from
he
pumps
it
up
from
deep
in
the
earth
calls
it
aqua
cola
and
claims
it
for
himself
and
because
he
owns
it
he
owns
all
of
us
i
dont
like
him
already
itll
take
two
weeks
to
skirt
the
wall
of
mountains
no
i
suggest
we
go
back
the
same
way
we
came
through
the
canyon
its
open
we
know
that
right
he
brought
all
his
war
parties
through
so
we
take
the
war
rig
and
we
charge
it
right
through
the
middle
of
them
we
can
decouple
the
tanker
at
the
pass
shut
it
off
behind
us
kaboom
and
how
exactly
do
we
take
the
citadel
assuming
were
still
alive
by
then
if
we
can
block
the
pass
itll
be
easy
all
thats
left
are
his
war
pups
and
war
boys
too
sick
to
fight
and
well
be
with
nux
hes
a
war
boy
hell
be
bringing
us
home
bringing
back
whats
stolen
as
hes
meant
to
yeah
it
feels
like
hope
i
like
this
plan
we
can
start
again
just
like
the
old
days
look
itll
be
a
hard
day
but
i
guarantee
you
that
a
160
days
ride
that
way
theres
nothing
but
salt
at
least
that
way
you
know
we
might
be
able
to
together
come
across
some
kind
of
redemption
war
rig
thats
the
war
rig
thats
them
why
are
they
going
back
do
they
wish
to
surrender
