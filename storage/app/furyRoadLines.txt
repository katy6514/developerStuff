My name is Max
My world is fire and blood
Why are you hurting these people?
Its the oil, stupid
Oil wars
We are killing for guzzoline
The world is running out of water
Now theres the water wars
Once, I was a cop
A road warrior searching
for a righteous cause
to the terminal freak-out point
Mankind has gone rogue, terrorizing itself
Thermonuclear skirmish
The earth is sour
Our bones are poisoned
We have become half-life
As the world fell
each of us, in our own way,
was broken
It was hard to know
who was more crazy
Me, or everyone else
Hello? Where are you?
Where are you, Max?
Here they come again
Max Rockatansky
Worming their way
into the black matter of my brain
Help us, Max
You promised to help us
I tell myself
they cannot touch me
They are long dead
I am the one
who runs from both
the living and the dead
Hunted by scavengers
Haunted by those I could not protect
So I exist in this wasteland
A man reduced to a single instinct
Survive
Max? Is that you?
Where were you?
Help us Where were you?
Where were you, Max?
Where were you, Max?
Stop running
You let us die!
You let us die!
You let us die!
You promised to help us!
Why?
Witness!

Once again, we send off my War Rig
to bring back
guzzoline from Gas Town
and bullets from the Bullet Farm!
Once again, I salute my Imperator Furiosa!
And I salute
my half-life War Boys
who will ride with me eternal
on the highways of Valhalla
V8! V8! V8! V8!
I am your redeemer
It is by my hand
you will rise from the ashes
of this world!

and you will resent its absence
Clear off!

Where is she taking them?
A long way from you

He was scanning the horizon
No, I am awaited
I am awaited in Valhalla!
Confucamus!
Immortan!
Hey! Heads up!
Heads up!

We got vehicles from the Citadel
Theyre firing flares

We need counterweight

Hey, head!
Say bye-bye to the neck!

Oh, what a day!

I am the man
who grabs the sun
riding to Valhalla!
Witness me Blood Bag!
Witness!
I live, I die, I live again!
Were not going back
Water
Angharad, is that just the wind
or is that a furious vexation?
I got it!
Glory me, Blood Bag!
We snagged her alive
Hes gonna shred her Shred her
Bolt cutters. Chain
Oh, look at them
So shiny So chrome
Hes gonna be so grateful
We could ask for anything
I wanna drive the War Rig
What are you gonna ask for?
Thats my jacket
Heh, heh Sure
You can ask for more than a jacket
Were going to the Green Place
Wait, its you and me Ugh!
Were going to the Green Place
of Many Mothers
How does it feel?
It hurts
Out here, everything hurts
You wanna get through this?
Do as I say
Now pick up what you can and run
Kill switches
I set the sequence myself
This Rig goes nowhere without me
You can get in
Not without them
So we wait
Youre relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man
Youve damaged one of his wives
How grateful do you think hes gonna be?
Youre sitting on 2000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted war machine
Id say you got
about a five-minute head start
You want that thing off your face?
Lets go
Of all the legs you had to shoot,
that one was attached to his favorite
Smeg!
You dont have to do it
just because he tells you
What choice does she have?
Hes not gonna hurt us He needs us
To bargain
Oh, hell hurt us
Think hes coming to the Green Place?
Never! Hes a crazy smeg
who eats Schlesinger!
Nah, stay out of there
Behind you
The Gas Town Boys
Dont damage the goods
What do you see?
Big Rigs
Polecats
Flamers
and theres the People Eater himself
Coming to count the cost
Were dragging something out back
I think its the fuel pod
No, no. Ill go
Filth! You traitored him!
No unnecessary killing!
This War Boy wants me dead!
We agreed!
Hes kamakrazee!
Hes just a kid
at the end of his half-life!
No! I live I die I live again!
Hold him! Tie him up!
Throw him out!
Chuck him out!
You got more friends
Bullet Farmer
Theyre coming from the Bullet Farm
Its over You cant defy him
Just watch us, mate!
He is the one
who grabbed the sun
Look how slick hes fooled you
Hes a lying old man
By his hand
well be lifted up!
Thats why we have
his logo seared on our backs!
Breeding Stock! Battle Fodder!
No, I am awaited!
Youre an old mans Battle Fodder!
Killing everyone
and everything
Were not to blame!
Then who killed the world?
I made a deal up ahead Safe passage
I dont know if its still any good
Get back in the hold!
Keep the hatch open
I need you here
You may have to drive the Rig
You stay. You stay there
Whatever you do, you cant be seen
Im supposed to be alone
That was the deal
Down here
Hey

Does it matter?
Fine
When I yell fool

as fast as you can
This is the sequence
One One, two

Three thousand gallons of guzzoline,
just like you asked!
Im gonna unhitch the pod
You drop the rocks
You said
A few vehicles in pursuit
Maybe
We count three War Parties!
Yeah, well, I got unlucky
Lets do this!
Fool!
Thats our fuel!
Make way for the Ripsaw!
Come on! Move them!
Once Im over

and bring everyone through
Immortan!
Immortan Joe!
I got a War Boy!
Says he was on the War Rig
You! Climb aboard!
Hey Hey!

I got the Blood Bags boot!
Take me! I got his boot!
All this for a family squabble
Healthy babies

Gun!

Not loaded yet!
We had a deal!
Rictus! The wives!
No more flames
Splendid! Thats my child!
My property!
Immortan If I get on the Rig,
theres a way inside
What is your name?
Its Nux
Ill pike her in the spine
Keep her breathing
Put a bullet in her skull
Stop the Rig,
return my treasures to me
and I, myself, will carry you
to the Gates
of Valhalla
Am I awaited?
You will ride eternal
shiny and chrome
Rictus! Help him aboard!
Aah! Mediocre!
Schlanger!
Look out!
Angharad! Get out!
No! Angharad!
Stop! Turn the Rig around!
Go back for her!
Tell him to turn the Rig around!
Did you see it?
She went under the wheels
Did you see it?
She went under the wheels
We keep moving
We keep moving!
He doesnt know what hes talking about!
Whatever happens,
were going to the Green Place
The stupid Green Place
We dont even know where to find it!
You all right?
Cheedo! Cheedo, dont be stupid
Stop!
Hell forgive us
I know he will
There is no going back!
We were his treasures!
We were protected!
He gave us the high life!
Whats wrong with that?
We are not things
We are not things!
We are not things
I dont want to hear that again!
They were her words!
And now shes dead!
Wring your hands and tear your hair
but youre not going back
Youre not going back to him
Come on! Come on!
So, um, where is this Green Place?
Its a long nights run, heading east
We need inventory
Match every gun with its bullets
Im gonna go and do some repairs
We need someone down the back
Ill go
No, I want you to stay together
I can do it
What are you doing here?
He saw it
He saw it all
My own Blood Bag driving the Rig
that killed her
Stop doing that
Shh Shh, shh, shh
Three times the gates were open to me
What gates?
I was awaited in Valhalla
They were calling my name
I should be walking with the Immorta
McFeasting with the heroes of all time
Id say it was
your manifest destiny not to
I thought I was being spared
for something great
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe
Who are Larry and Barry?
My mates
Larry and Barry
If they dont get me,
then the Night Fevers will
Well, weve only got four for Big Boy here,
so hes all but useless
we can squirt off this little pinky
a raunchy 29 times
Angharad used to call them Antiseed
Plant one and watch the thing die
Hold on, mate
We are down
30,000 units of guzzoline
19 canisters of nitro,
12 assault bikes
seven pursuit vehicles
The deficit mounts
And now, sir
you have us stuck in a quagmire
Hey, Joe! Boss!
Your girlys breathing her last!
What about the child?
Are you coming, brother?
Its gone awful quiet in there
Get it out. Get it out!
Come on! Ive been called to the torture!
Patience!
Oh, you stay here with your grief, Daddy
Ill fetch them for you
Be careful! Protect the assets!
Just one angry shot
for Furiosa!
Crying shame Heh
Come another month
could have been your viable human!
Was it a male?
Your A-1 Alpha prime
Hey, Rictus!
You lost a baby brother!
Perfect in every way
I had a baby brother!
I had a little baby brother!
And he was perfect!
Perfect in every way!
Wouldnt wanna shoot the wives, sir
Just probing
He wants to help!
Who? The War Boy!
Where did he come from?
I thought we threw him off the Rig!
Theres high ground
just beyond that thing
He means the tree
Yeah Tree!
Leave him to me
Say, anyone notice that bright light?
Encroaching gunfire?
Get out
I can do this
I know this machine
He does Hes a Revhead
Youve got two left!
Dont breathe
War Boy!
Im gonna use the winch
around the tree thing!
Take this
Lets get the engine plates
You drive the Rig!
Hold up a flare!
I am holding a flare!
Closer!
Its right in front of your eyes!
Blood Bag!
I am the scales of justice!
Conductor of the choir of death!
Sing, Brother Heckler
Sing, Brother Koch!
Sing, brothers, sing! Sing!
Dont they know theyre shooting at us?
Gun fever!
I never thought Id do something
as shine as that
How are the engines?
Very hot and real thirsty
You need to take the War Rig
half a klick down the track
What if youre not back by the time
the engines have cooled?
Well, you keep moving
What do you suppose hes gonna do?
Retaliate first
Lets go!
Are you hurt?
Youre bleeding
Thats not his blood
What is this?
Its Mothers Milk
Its okay
Sleep
Get some rest
How do you know
this place even exists?
I was born there
So whyd you leave?
I was taken as a child. Stolen
You done this before?
Many times
Now that I drive a War Rig
this is the best shot Ill ever have
And them?
Theyre looking for hope
What about you?
Redemption
Hey, whats that?
I remember something like that
Help me! Help me, please!
Thats bait
Stay in the Rig
Hurry! Please, hurry! Theyll be back!
I am one of the Vuvalini!
Of the Many Mothers!
My Initiate Mother was KT Concannon!
I am the daughter of Mary Jobassa
My clan was Swaddle Dog!
Theres something in the eyes
Perhaps it is Jobassas child
This is our Furiosa
How long has it been?
Seven thousand days
Plus the ones I dont remember
Furiosa, What happened to your mother?
She died. On the third day
From where did you come?
The West Citadel Beyond the mountains
The men. Who are they?
Theyre reliable
They helped us get here
Where did you find such creatures?
So soft
This one has all her teeth!
I cant wait for them to see it
See? See what?
Home. The Green Place
But if you came from the West
you passed it
The crows
The creepy place with all the crows
The soil
We had to get out
We had no water
The water was filth
It was poisoned
It was sour
And then the crows came
We couldnt grow anything
Where are the others?
What others?
The Many Mothers
Were the only ones left
Thats what you call a satellite
Miss Giddy told us about those
They used to bounce messages
across the Earth
Everyone in the old world
had a show
Do you think theres still
somebody out there?
Sending shows?
Who knows?
Those are the Plains of Silence
Stay right where you are, little Joe
Kind of lost its novelty out here
You having a baby?
Warlord Junior
Gonna be so ugly
It could be a girl
You kill people with that, do you?
Killed everyone
I ever met out here
Headshots All of them
Snap Right in the medulla
Thought somehow you girls
were above that
Come here. Take a peek
Seeds.
These are from home
Heirlooms The real thing
I plant one every chance I get
Where?
So far, nothings took
Earths too sour
Aah So many different kinds
Trees, flowers, fruit
Back then, everyone had their fill
Back then,
there was no need to snap anybody
Can I talk to you?
Ive talked with the others
Were never gonna have a better chance
to make it across the salt
If we leave the Rig here, and load the
motorcycles up with as much as we can
we can maybe ride for 160 days
One of those bikes is yours
Fully loaded
Youre more than welcome
to come with us
Ill make my own way
You know, hope is a mistake
If you cant fix whats broken, youll, uh
Youll go insane
Where are you, Max?
Where are you?
Help us You promised to help us
Come on, Pa! Lets go
All right
This is your way home
We go back?
I thought you werent insane anymore
What are they saying?
He wants to go back from where they came
The Citadel
Whats there to find at the Citadel?
Green
And water
Theres a ridiculous amount of clear water
And a lot of crops
Got everything you need
Long as youre not afraid of heights
Where does the water come from?
He pumps it up from deep in the earth
Calls it Aqua Cola and claims it for himself
And because he owns it, he owns all of us
I dont like him already
Itll take two weeks
to skirt the Wall of Mountains
I suggest we go back
the same way we came
Through the canyon
Its open We know that Right?
He brought all his war parties through
So we take the War Rig and we charge it
right through the middle of them
We can decouple the tanker
at the pass
Shut it off behind us
Kaboom
And how exactly do
we take the Citadel?
Assuming were still alive by then
If we can block the pass, itll be easy
All thats left are his War Pups
and War Boys too sick to fight
And well be with Nux
Hes a War Boy
Hell be bringing us home
Bringing back whats stolen, as hes meant to
It feels like hope
I like this plan
We can start again
Just like the old days!
Itll be a hard day
But I guarantee you
that a 160 days ride that way
theres nothing but salt
At least that way, you know,
we might be able to, together
come across some kind of redemption
War Rig!
Thats the War Rig!
Thats them
Why are they going back?
Do they wish to surrender?
They are heading for the canyon
Theyre going back to the Citadel!
They know its undefended!
Bollocks! Roll up!
What are you doing?
Praying
To who?
Anyone thats listening
Here we go, girls!
Thats mine!
Hell try to get in front of us
Spike our wheels
Dont blow my engine
Gonna nudge him
Just a little
You filth! You traitored him!
Gotta back off
Engine one is gone
Twos about to blow
Are you a Black Thumb?
All right Engine one Now
You and me Fifth wheel
Well unhook the tanker
One man, one bullet
I cannot see
Maadi! Maadi!
I cant see
Harpoons and plows!
Theyre hauling us back!
Leave three bolts Three
Hey, you! Aargh!
Are you okay?
I think shes hurt
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Hey! Are you there?
You finish that! Ill finish her!
Valhalla!
Engine ones good
For now
Shes hurt!
Shes hurt real bad!
You hear that?
Were gonna see two airborne V8s
Im gonna need you to drive
Ill get him out of our way
Rictus! Take me!
Cheedo! What are you doing?
Good girl Come here
Big Boy!
Here! Here!
Remember me?
Hes dead!
Hes dead
When youre across safe,
Ill jam the throttle and follow you
Hurry! Were nearly at the pass
Witness me
Rictus!
Why is she making that noise?
Shes pumping air into her chest cavity
Shes collapsing her lungs
one breath at a time
I know. I am so sorry
I know I know
Hold it there
All right
Put that on there Press it in
Shes exsanguinated
Drained all her blood
Hold these
We need that
